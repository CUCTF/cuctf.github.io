# CUCyber @ Columbia University

Columbia University's student organization CUCyber webpage.


## Development

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).
To get the site running locally follow the following steps:

1. Install Ruby version 2.4.0 or above, Jekyll and bundler gems.
For details about how to do this in your operating system, check [Jekyll Installation Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation).

2. Run `bundle install` to install the required gems.

3. Build the site and make it available on a local server by running:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

4. Check the webpage at http://localhost:4000.

### Modify the webpage's content

Most of the webpage's content is on [_config.yml](_config.yml) (mailing list, calendar link, etc.) and in the files in the [_data](/_data) directory (team pictures, story, etc.).
When modifing [_config.yml](_config.yml), you will need to restart the server.
The changes in the [_data](/_data) are visible by just reloading the page.
