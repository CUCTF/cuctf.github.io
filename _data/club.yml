  Columbia University's student organization CUCyber is a place for students to experience cybersecurity in practice and familiarize themselves with industry standards.
  
  We are a constantly growing team of highly engaged students, who meet regularly to share thoughts on security topics, discuss hacker news and participate in competitions such as Hackathons and Capture the Flags (CTF).

As campus club, our ambitions are three-folded:
        
Improving our own technical skills, providing a link between academia and industry and serving the community by bringing security education to non-security majors. As such, we are happy to provide training, and to host info sessions with industry contacts.
